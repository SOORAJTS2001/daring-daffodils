Sure, you have a perfectly good keyboard and mouse‚Ä¶ but why not run Python in your browser with a mobile?
What about doing a scroll, drag and maybe a click or that's all ?

That is Misclick - A way to control your mouse, **but in opposite way**

## What can it do ?

- Oh, just casually pair your phone with your browser over WebSocket ‚Äî because Bluetooth and USB are *too mainstream*.
- Control your browser‚Äôs mouse with your phone, but in reverse. Yes, swipe left to go right. Because logic is overrated.
    - What‚Äôs on the menu?
        - Swipe left, swipe right ‚Äî like Tinder, but for your cursor.
        - Swipe up or swipe down.
        - Click links and sections ‚Äî basically what your mouse already does, but now slower and more annoying.
        - Scroll up, scroll down ‚Äî congratulations, you‚Äôve invented scrolling.
- Feeling idle? Don‚Äôt worry, the mouse entertains itself with *modes*:
    - **Wander Mode** ‚Äì your cursor takes itself on a joyride. You‚Äôre just a spectator.
    - **Rage Mode** ‚Äì because why not double the speed and lose control even faster?
    - **Shadow Mode** ‚Äì cursor goes invisible. Perfect for when you *really* want to rage-quit.
    - Sometimes you get all of them combined, so best of luck.
    - Bonus: it randomly clicks on stuff, so enjoy your surprise shopping carts and unexpected **easter eggs**.
    - If you get redirected to another page, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî the chaos restarts automatically.
- **Drag text from your browser and send it to your phone. Groundbreaking. Nobel-worthy.**
- Install it as a browser extension, and enjoy the privilege of also opening a webpage on your phone. Wow.
- Cross-platform. Yes, it works everywhere, so nobody is safe.
- Runs locally, no hosting, no leaks ‚Äî except your sanity.
- No accounts, no personal info ‚Äî because who would *willingly* sign up for this anyway?
